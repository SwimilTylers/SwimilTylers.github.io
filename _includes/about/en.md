Hi, my name is @Swimiltylers (Yi-Jiang Yang). I'm an undergraduate-to-be in Nanjing University, majoring computer science. I'm follow Prof.Huang to research on distributed system, e.t. Paxos. I have participated in MCM/ICM-2018 and honored to be in a Meritorious Winner team. I used to study in Metric Learning with Prof.Zhan - well, that's another story.

Actually, I' m a trekker (rather than _trekkie_) and I'm fascinated in several new sci-fi series, such as _the expanse_. Besides, I have learnt guitar, Chinese flute and piano as well - eager to explore the myth of muse. I travel several place every year and get quite a lot pics - I'm really not willing to stuck in one place.
